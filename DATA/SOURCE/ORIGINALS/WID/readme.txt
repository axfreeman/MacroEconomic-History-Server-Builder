This ZIP file contains all WID.world data for all Wid.world available countries as of 26-02-2019 at 13:56:23 (GMT)
===================================================================================================================

The WID_full_dataset folder contains data for all countries on WID.world

Within each country folder the DATA folder contains two files:

-WID_XX_MacroData.csv, which contains macro data series (aggregate and total income and wealth variables, as well as population variables and other macro indicator such as deflators, exchange rates, etc.)

-WID_XX_InequalityData.csv, which contains inequality data series (income and wealth shares, thresholds, averages for different percentiles of the population).

The list of 2-letter country codes and their associated country names is provided at the end of this readme file.

HOW TO INTERPRET INEQUALITY DATA AND PERCENTILES ON WID.WORLD?
=============================================================

We explain below the key features of the notation used in WID.world, to help users properly understand and interpret the inequality data provided in the database.

There are two types of percentiles in WID.world: grouped percentiles and generalized percentiles. The interpretation of income and wealth averages, shares, and thresholds depends on which type of percentile is looked at.

Grouped percentiles

Grouped percentiles are denoted as follows: p0p50 (bottom 50% of the target population), p50p90 (next 40%), p90p100 (top 10%), p99p100 (top 1%), p0p10 (bottom 10% of the population, ie. first decile), p10p20 (next 10%, ie. second decile), p20p30 (next 10%, ie. third decile), p30p40 (next 10%, ie. fourth decile), p40p50 (next 10%, ie. fifth decile), p50p60 (next 10%, ie. sixth decile), p60p70 (next 10%, ie. seventh decile), p70p80 (next 10%, ie. eighth decile), p80p90 (next 10%, ie. ninth decile), p0p90 (bottom 90%), p0p99 (bottom 99%), p99.9p100 (top 0.1%), p99.99p100 (top 0.01%).

For each grouped percentile, we provide (whenever possible) the associated income and wealth shares, averages, and thresholds.

i) grouped percentile shares correspond to the share of income (or wealth) held by a given grouped percentile. For instance, the fiscal income share of group p0p50 is the share of total fiscal income accrued to the bottom 50% group.

ii) grouped percentile averages correspond to the average income (or wealth) of a given grouped percentile. For instance, the fiscal income average of group p0p50 is the average annual fiscal income of the bottom 50% group.

iii) grouped percentile thresholds correspond to the minimum income (or wealth) level required to belong to a given grouped percentile. For instance, the fiscal income threshold of group p90p100 is the minimum annual fiscal income necessary to belong to the top 10% group, i.e. the 90th percentile income threshold.

For countries where the data permit, WID.world also makes it possible to retrieve shares, averages, and thresholds for any grouped percentile pxpy (where x and y are any two given generalized percentiles, e.g. p43p99.92; see below). However, these are not stored in the country full datasets provided in the Data section, but they need to be selected through the custom menu.

In contrast, for a number of countries we are not able to provide the series for all grouped percentiles described above, due to data limitations. Instead, we provide series for specific ones (these can be, depending on the countries, p90p95, p95p100, p95p99, p99.5p100, p99.5p99.9, p99.75p100, p99.95p100, p99.95p99.99, p99.995p100, p99.9p99.95, p99.9p99.99 or p99p99.5).

Generalized percentiles

WID.world also defines 127  generalized percentiles (g-percentiles) that are denoted as p0, p1, p2, …, p99, p99.1, p99.2, …, p99.9, p99.91, p99.92, …, p99.99, p99.991, p99.992 ,…, p99.999.

For each g-percentile, we provide shares, averages, thresholds (as for grouped percentiles), as well as what we call top-averages.

i) g–percentile shares correspond to the income (or wealth) share captured by the population group above a given g-percentile value. For example, the fiscal income share of g-percentile p90 corresponds to the fiscal income share held by the top 10% group; the fiscal income share of g-percentile p99.9 corresponds to the fiscal income share of the top 0.1% income group, and so on. By construction, the fiscal income share of g-percentile p0 corresponds to the share held by 100% of the target population, and it is equal to 100%. The g-percentile share at g-percentile px corresponds to the share of the top (100-x)% group.

ii) g–percentile averages correspond to the average income (or wealth) between two consecutive g-percentiles. Therefore, the average income of g-percentile p0 corresponds to the average annual income of the bottom 1% group, p2 corresponds to the next 1% group, and so on until p98 (the 1% population group below the top 1%).

Average income of g-percentile p99 corresponds to average annual income of grouped percentile p99p99.1 (ie. the bottom 10% group within the top 1% group), p99.1 corresponds to the next 0.1%, p99.2 corresponds to the next 0.1%, and so on until p99.8.

Average income of p99.9 corresponds to the average annual income of group percentile p99.9p99.91 (ie. the bottom 10% group of earners within the top 0.1% group of earners), p99.91 corresponds to the next 0.01% group, p99.92 corresponds to the next 0.01% group and so on until p99.98.

The average income of p99.99 corresponds to the average annual income of group percentile p99.99p99.991 (i.e. the bottom 10% group within the top 0.01% group of earners), p99.991 corresponds to the next 0.001%, p99.992 corresponds to the next 0.001%, and so on until p99.999 (average income of the top 0.001%).

As an example, the average fiscal income of g-percentile p50 is the average annual fiscal income of the p50p51 group (i.e. the average annual income of the population group earning more than 50% of the population and less than the top 49% of the population). The average fiscal income of g-percentile p99 is the average annual fiscal income within group percentile p99p99.1 (ie. a group representing 0.1% of the total population earning more than 99% of the population but less than the top 0.9% of the population).

iii) g–percentile thresholds are the minimum income (or wealth) levels required to belong to the group above a given g-percentile value. For instance, the fiscal income threshold at g-percentile p90 is the minimum annual fiscal income required to belong to the top 10% group. Fiscal income threshold at g-percentile p99.9 is the minimum annual fiscal income required to belong to the top 0.1% group. The g-percentile threshold at g-percentile px is the threshold of the top (100-x)% group.

iv) g–percentile top–averages are the average income (or wealth) above a given g-percentile threshold. For instance, the top-average fiscal income at g-percentile p50 correspond to the average annual fiscal income of individuals earning more than 50% of the target population. The top average fiscal income at g-percentile p90 is the average annual fiscal income of the top 10% group.
