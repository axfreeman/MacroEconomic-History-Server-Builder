D.<BR>      January 17, 2006</FONT></P>      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Abstract: the proposed Iranian      Oil Bourse will accelerate the fall of the American Empire.</FONT></P>      <P><B><FONT FACE="Verdana">I. Economics of Empires<BR><BR>      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">A nation-state taxes      its own citizens, while an empire taxes other nation-states.      The history of empires, from Greek and Roman, to Ottoman and      British, teaches that the economic foundation of every single      empire is the taxation of other nations. The imperial ability      to tax has always rested on a better and stronger economy, and      as a consequence, a better and stronger military. One part of      the subject taxes went to improve the living standards of the      empire; the other part went to strengthen the military dominance      necessary to enforce the collection of those taxes.</FONT></P>      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Historically, taxing the subject      state has been in various forms - usually gold and silver, where      those were considered money, but also slaves, soldiers, crops,      cattle, or other agricultural and natural resources, whatever      economic goods the empire demanded and the subject-state could      deliver. Historically, imperial taxation has always been direct:      the subject state handed over the economic goods directly to      the empire.</FONT></P>      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">For the first time in history,      in the twentieth century, America was able to tax the world indirectly,      through inflation. It did not enforce the direct payment of taxes      like all of its predecessor empires did, but distributed instead      its own fiat currency, the U.S. Dollar, to other nations in exchange      for goods with the intended consequence of inflating and devaluing      those dollars and paying back later each dollar with less economic      goods - the difference capturing the U.S. imperial tax. Here      is how this happened.</FONT></P>      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Early in the 20th century,      the U.S. economy began to dominate the world economy. The U.S.      dollar was tied to gold, so that the value of the dollar neither      increased, nor decreased, but remained the same amount of gold.      The Great Depression, with its preceding inflation from 1921      to 1929 and its subsequent ballooning government deficits, had      substantially increased the amount of currency in circulation,      and thus rendered the backing of U.S. dollars by gold impossible.      This led Roosevelt to decouple the dollar from gold in 1932.      Up to this point, the U.S. may have well dominated the world      economy, but from an economic point of view, it was not an empire.      The fixed value of the dollar did not allow the Americans to      extract economic benefits from other countries by supplying them      with dollars convertible to gold.</FONT></P>      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Economically, the American      Empire was born with Bretton Woods in 1945. The U.S. dollar was      not fully convertible to gold, but was made convertible to gold      only to foreign governments. This established the dollar as the      reserve currency of the world. It was possible, because during      WWII, the United States had supplied its allies with provisions,      demanding gold as payment, thus accumulating significant portion      of the world's gold. An Empire would not have been possible if,      following the Bretton Woods arrangement, the dollar supply was      kept limited and within the availability of gold, so as to fully      exchange back dollars for gold. However, the guns-and-butter      policy of the 1960's was an imperial one: the dollar supply was      relentlessly increased to finance Vietnam and LBJ's Great Society.      Most of those dollars were handed over to foreigners in exchange      for economic goods, without the prospect of buying them back      at the same value. The increase in dollar holdings of foreigners      via persistent U.S. trade deficits was tantamount to a tax -      the classical inflation tax that a country imposes on its own      citizens, this time around an inflation tax that U.S. imposed      on rest of the world.</FONT></P>      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">When in 1970-1971 foreigners      demanded payment for their dollars in gold, The U.S. Government      defaulted on its payment on August 15, 1971. While the popular      spin told the story of &quot;severing the link between the dollar      and gold&quot;, in reality the denial to pay back in gold was      an act of bankruptcy by the U.S. Government. Essentially, the      U.S. declared itself an Empire. It had extracted an enormous      amount of economic goods from the rest of the world, with no      intention or ability to return those goods, and the world was      powerless to respond - the world was taxed and it could not do      anything about it.</FONT></P>      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">From that point on, to sustain      the American Empire and to continue to tax the rest of the world,      the United States had to force the world to continue to accept      ever-depreciating dollars in exchange for economic goods and      to have the world hold more and more of those depreciating dollars.      It had to give the world an economic reason to hold them, and      that reason was oil.</FONT></P>      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In 1971, as it became clearer      and clearer that the U.S Government would not be able to buy      back its dollars in gold, it made in 1972-73 an iron-clad arrangement      with Saudi Arabia to support the power of the House of Saud in      exchange for accepting only U.S. dollars for its oil. The rest      of OPEC was to follow suit and also accept only dollars. Because      the world had to buy oil from the Arab oil countries, it had      the reason to hold dollars as payment for oil. Because the world      needed ever increasing quantities of oil at ever increasing oil      prices, the world's demand for dollars could only increase. Even      though dollars could no longer be exchanged for gold, they were      now exchangeable for oil.</FONT></P>      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The economic essence of this      arrangement was that the dollar was now backed by oil. As long      as that was the case, the world had to accumulate increasing      amounts of dollars, because they needed those dollars to buy      oil. As long as the dollar was the only acceptable payment for      oil, its dominance in the world was assured, and the American      Empire could continue to tax the rest of the world. If, for any      reason, the dollar lost its oil backing, the American Empire      would cease to exist. Thus, Imperial survival dictated that oil      be sold only for dollars. It also dictated that oil reserves      were spread around various sovereign states that weren't strong      enough, politically or militarily, to demand payment for oil      in something else. If someone demanded a different payment, he      had to be convinced, either by political pressure or military      means, to change his mind.</FONT></P>      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The man that actually did demand      Euro for his oil was Saddam Hussein in 2000. At first, his demand      was met with ridicule, later with neglect, but as it became clearer      that he meant business, political pressure was exerted to change      his mind. When other countries, like Iran, wanted payment in      other currencies, most notably Euro and Yen, the danger to the      dollar was clear and present, and a punitive action was in order.      Bush's Shock-and-Awe in Iraq was not about Saddam's nuclear capabilities,      about defending human rights, about spreading democracy, or even      about seizing oil fields; it was about defending the dollar,      ergo the American Empire. It was about setting an example that      anyone who demanded payment in currencies other than U.S. Dollars      would be likewise punished.</FONT></P>      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Many have criticized Bush for      staging the war in Iraq in order to seize Iraqi oil fields. However,      those critics can't explain why Bush would want to seize those      fields - he could simply print dollars for nothing and use them      to get all the oil in the world that he needs. He must have had      some other reason to invade Iraq.</FONT></P>      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">History teaches that an empire      should go to war for one of two reasons: (1) to defend itself      or (2) benefit from war; if not, as Paul Kennedy illustrates      in his magisterial <I>The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers</I>,      a military overstretch will drain its economic resources and      precipitate its collapse. Economically speaking, in order for      an empire to initiate and conduct a war, its benefits must outweigh      its military and social costs. Benefits from Iraqi oil fields      are hardly worth the long-term, multi-year military cost. Instead,      Bush must have went into Iraq to defend his Empire. Indeed, this      is the case: two months after the United States invaded Iraq,      the Oil for Food Program was terminated, the Iraqi Euro accounts      were switched back to dollars, and oil was sold once again only      for U.S. dollars. No longer could the world buy oil from Iraq      with Euro. Global dollar supremacy was once again restored. Bush      descended victoriously from a fighter jet and declared the mission      accomplished - he had successfully defended the U.S. dollar,      and thus the American Empire.</FONT></P>      <P><B><FONT FACE="Verdana">II. Iranian Oil Bourse</FONT></B></P>      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The Iranian government has      finally developed the ultimate &quot;nuclear&quot; weapon that      can swiftly destroy the financial system underpinning the American      Empire. That weapon is the Iranian Oil Bourse slated to open      in March 2006. It will be based on a euro-oil-trading mechanism      that naturally implies payment for oil in Euro. In economic terms,      this represents a much greater threat to the hegemony of the      dollar than Saddam's, because it will allow anyone willing either      to buy or to sell oil for Euro to transact on the exchange, thus      circumventing the U.S. dollar altogether. If so, then it is likely      that almost everyone will eagerly adopt this euro oil system:</FONT></P>      <UL>        <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The <I>Europeans</I> will        not have to buy and hold dollars in order to secure their payment        for oil, but would instead pay with their own currencies. The        adoption of the euro for oil transactions will provide the European        currency with a reserve status that will benefit the European        at the expense of the Americans.<BR>        </FONT><FONT COLOR="#cccc99" SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">.</FONT><FONT         SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"></FONT>        <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The <I>Chinese</I> and the        <I>Japanese </I>will be especially eager to adopt the new exchange,        because it will allow them to drastically lower their enormous        dollar reserves and diversify with Euros, thus protecting themselves        against the depreciation of the dollar. One portion of their        dollars they will still want to hold onto; a second portion of        their dollar holdings they may decide to dump outright; a third        portion of their dollars they will decide to use up for future        payments without replenishing those dollar holdings, but building        up instead their euro reserves.<BR>        </FONT><FONT COLOR="#cccc99" SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">.</FONT><FONT         SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"></FONT>        <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The <I>Russians</I> have inherent        economic interest in adopting the Euro - the bulk of their trade        is with European countries, with oil-exporting countries, with        China, and with Japan. Adoption of the Euro will immediately        take care of the first two blocs, and will over time facilitate        trade with China and Japan. Also, the Russians seemingly detest        holding depreciating dollars, for they have recently found a        new religion with gold. Russians have also revived their nationalism,        and if embracing the Euro will stab the Americans, they will        gladly do it and smugly watch the Americans bleed.<BR>        </FONT><FONT COLOR="#cccc99" SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">.</FONT><FONT         SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana"></FONT>        <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The <I>Arab</I> oil-exporting        countries will eagerly adopt the Euro as a means of diversifying        against rising mountains of depreciating dollars. Just like the        Russians, their trade is mostly with European countries, and        therefore will prefer the European currency both for its stability        and for avoiding currency risk, not to mention their jihad against        the Infidel Enemy.</FONT>      </UL>      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Only the British will find      themselves between a rock and a hard place. They have had a strategic      partnership with the U.S. forever, but have also had their natural      pull from Europe. So far, they have had many reasons to stick      with the winner. However, when they see their century-old partner      falling, will they firmly stand behind him or will they deliver      the coup de grace? Still, we should not forget that currently      the two leading oil exchanges are the New York's NYMEX and the      London's International Petroleum Exchange (IPE), even though      both of them are effectively owned by the Americans. It seems      more likely that the British will have to go down with the sinking      ship, for otherwise they will be shooting themselves in the foot      by hurting their own London IPE interests. It is here noteworthy      that for all the rhetoric about the reasons for the surviving      British Pound, the British most likely did not adopt the Euro      namely because the Americans must have pressured them not to:      otherwise the London IPE would have had to switch to Euros, thus      mortally wounding the dollar and their strategic partner.</FONT></P>      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">At any rate, no matter what      the British decide, should the Iranian Oil Bourse accelerate,      the interests that matter-those of Europeans, Chinese, Japanese,      Russians, and Arabs-will eagerly adopt the Euro, thus sealing      the fate of the dollar. Americans cannot allow this to happen,      and if necessary, will use a vast array of strategies to halt      or hobble the operation's exchange:</FONT></P>      <UL>        <LI><I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Sabotaging the Exchange        </FONT></I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">- this could be a computer        virus, network, communications, or server attack, various server        security breaches, or a 9-11-type attack on main and backup facilities.<BR>        </FONT><FONT COLOR="#cccc99" SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">.</FONT>        <LI><I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Coup d'&eacute;tat </FONT></I><FONT         SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">- this is by far the best long-term        strategy available to the Americans.<BR>        </FONT><FONT COLOR="#cccc99" SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">.</FONT>        <LI><I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Negotiating Acceptable        Terms &amp; Limitations </FONT></I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">-        this is another excellent solution to the Americans. Of course,        a government coup is clearly the preferred strategy, for it will        ensure that the exchange does not operate at all and does not        threaten American interests. However, if an attempted sabotage        or coup d'etat fails, then negotiation is clearly the second-best        available option.<BR>        </FONT><FONT COLOR="#cccc99" SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">.</FONT>        <LI><I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Joint U.N.

First, the U.S. military resources have been already        depleted with two wars. Secondly, the Americans will further        alienate other powerful nations. Third, major dollar-holding        countries may decide to quietly retaliate by dumping their own        mountains of dollars, thus preventing the U.S. from further financing        its militant ambitions. Finally, Iran has strategic alliances        with other powerful nations that may trigger their involvement        in war; Iran reputedly has such alliance with China, India, and        Russia, known as the Shanghai Cooperative Group, a.k.a. Shanghai        Coop and a separate pact with Syria.</FONT>      </UL>      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Whatever the strategic choice,      from a purely economic point of view, should the Iranian Oil      Bourse gain momentum, it will be eagerly embraced by major economic      powers and will precipitate the demise of the dollar. The collapsing      dollar will dramatically accelerate U.S. inflation and will pressure      upward U.S. long-term interest rates. At this point, the Fed      will find itself between Scylla and Charybdis - between deflation      and hyperinflation - it will be forced fast either to take its      &quot;classical medicine&quot; by deflating, whereby it raises      interest rates, thus inducing a major economic depression, a      collapse in real estate, and an implosion in bond, stock, and      derivative markets, with a total financial collapse, or alternatively,      to take the Weimar way out by inflating, whereby it pegs the      long-bond yield, raises the Helicopters and drowns the financial      system in liquidity, bailing out numerous LTCMs and hyperinflating      the economy.</FONT></P>      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The Austrian theory of money,      credit, and business cycles teaches us that there is no in-between      Scylla and Charybdis. Sooner or later, the monetary system must      swing one way or the other, forcing the Fed to make its choice.      No doubt, Commander-in-Chief Ben Bernanke, a renowned scholar      of the Great Depression and an adept Black Hawk pilot, will choose      inflation. Helicopter Ben, oblivious to Rothbard's <I>America's      Great Depression, </I>has nonetheless mastered the lessons of      the Great Depression and the annihilating power of deflations.      The Maestro has taught him the panacea of every single financial      problem-to inflate, come hell or high water. He has even taught      the Japanese his own ingenious unconventional ways to battle      the deflationary liquidity trap. Like his mentor, he has dreamed      of battling a Kondratieff Winter. To avoid deflation, he will      resort to the printing presses; he will recall all helicopters      from the 800 overseas U.S. military bases; and, if necessary,      he will monetize everything in sight. His ultimate accomplishment      will be the hyperinflationary destruction of the American currency      and from its ashes will rise the next reserve currency of the      world-that barbarous relic called gold.</FONT></P>      <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Recommended Reading<BR>      </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">William Clark <A HREF="http://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/RRiraqWar.html">The      Real Reasons for the Upcoming War in Iraq</A><BR>      William Clark <A HREF="http://globalresearch.ca/articles/CLA410A.html">The      Real Reasons Why Iran is the Next Target</A></FONT></P>      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Krassimir Petrov<BR>      <!--include .txt--><!--NOEDIT--><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">email: <A HREF="mailto:Krassimir_Petrov@hotmail.com">Krassimir_Petrov@hotmail.com<BR></A>Petrov <A HREF="http://www.321gold.com/archives/archives_authors.php?author=Krassimir+Petrov">Archives</A></FONT></P><P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">About the Author<BR></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Krassimir Petrov<!--SELECTION--><!--/SELECTION-->has received his Ph.
